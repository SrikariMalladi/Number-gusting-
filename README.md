Introducing a fun and interactive Java program - the 'Guess the Number' game!  
It's all about guessing a number between 1 and 100, and you can play it easily. 
Just enter your guess, and the program will let you know if it's too high or too low. 
Keep guessing until you find the right number! Each time you guess correctly, 
the program will show you how many tries it took. If you want more fun,
you can play again by typing 'yes' or exit the game by typing 'no'. 
It's a simple way to test your guessing skills and enjoy the challenge! 
Give it a try today!
